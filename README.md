# kickr-rpi-ws281x

## Overview

This is small software + hardware project for use on a Raspberry Pi 3.

Its purpose is to control a programmable LED light strip with the power output from a Wahoo KICKR trainer (or maybe a TICKR Heart rate monitor) over BLE.  In other words, if you pedal easy, the LEDs will pulse a slow green, but if pedal hard, the LEDs will turn blick red, orange or yellow.

| Watts | LED Color |
| --- | ----------- |
| 0-99 Watts | Green |
| 100-199 Watts | Blue |
| 200-299 Watts | Violet |
| 300-399 Watts | Red |
| 400-499 Watts | Orange |
| 500-599 Watts | Yellow |
| 600+ Watts | Party mode/Surprise |
